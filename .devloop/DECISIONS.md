# Decisions

Plan changes only — tasks added, split, re-scoped, or dropped, each with its reason.

## 2026-08-22 — initial plan

Twenty tasks, agreed with Emma during `/devloop-init`. Notes on the shape of the list:

- **T5, T10 and T13 start `blocked` on captured AO3 markup.** The loop's shell has no network, so
  a parser it wrote would be green against HTML invented by the model — which is precisely what
  this project's verify-don't-guess rule exists to prevent. They unblock when a human saves the
  named file under `backend/Ao3Tracker.Tests/Fixtures/`.
- **The AO3 login gate (T2) lands before the login flow (T5) works.** That is deliberate and was
  agreed: it is phase 3 before phase 4 of the instance-credential plan. The gate is on a
  credential *existing*, not on a session being live.
- **Auto-downloading on saved-filter match was considered and dropped.** Every download stays a
  request someone made; an unattended rule could generate a lot of AO3 traffic.
- **The frontend gets no test runner.** There is none today, and adding one is not in scope; UI
  tasks verify through `tsc -b` plus a live check against a throwaway instance.
